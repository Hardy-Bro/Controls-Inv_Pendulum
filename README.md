# Controls-Inv_Pendulum
Contains my python code for ERC mini-project 'Controls'



-----CARTPOLE:------

This project required us to balance an inverted Pendulum on a cartpole that takes input as following:
1: Cart moves right
0: Cart moves left

Using the concept of deriviatives from PID controllers and angle inequalities, it was observed what the value of angle was at the given moment, and where it was heading, and then the required action was taken.


-----BALL-BEAM:-----

This project required us to balance a ball in the centre of the beam and took the following actions as input:
Angle: A continuous range of the angles that the beam can take

Using the concept of PID controllers, the error in position and velocity was observed and put in the PID controller, and the desired result was achieved after proper tuning.
